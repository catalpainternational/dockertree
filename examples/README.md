# Dockertree Examples

This directory contains example files for dockertree projects.

## Files

- `minimal-docker-compose.yml` - A minimal Docker Compose file that dockertree can use as a starting point for new projects

## Usage

When running `dockertree setup` in a project without an existing `docker-compose.yml`, dockertree will create a minimal compose file similar to the one in this directory.

You can use this file as a reference or copy it to your project root if needed.
