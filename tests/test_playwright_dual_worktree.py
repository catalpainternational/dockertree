"""
Playwright test for dual worktree login and navigation.

This test verifies that two separate worktree instances (bug and fix) can be:
1. Created and started simultaneously
2. Accessed via their respective subdomains
3. Logged into with the same credentials
4. Navigated to settings pages independently
5. Operate in complete isolation from each other

Test Requirements:
- Username: testuser
- Password: testpassword
- Worktrees: bug.localhost and fix.localhost
- Navigation: Both instances should be able to access /administration/settings/
